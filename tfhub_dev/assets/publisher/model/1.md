## Overview
Agripredict sets to leverage the use of machine learning to diagnose common plant pests and diseases. [About AgriPredict](https://agripredict.com)

The model uses the MobileNet V1 architecture, covering diseases for crops such as Maize (Corn), Soy, Cabbage and Tomatoes. It is trained on an internal AgriPredict dataset containing over 14 classes. AgriPredict intends to publish more versions of the model in the future with better accuracy and performance.
